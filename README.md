This repository demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript error related to division by zero.  The `foo` function attempts to handle the case where both inputs are zero, but division by zero when only the denominator is zero results in `Infinity`. This behavior can be unexpected and lead to subtle bugs. The solution demonstrates how to explicitly check for and handle division by zero, preventing the `Infinity` result.
